# terminal-graphics
I wrote this thing because I had to use TurboC in college for an introduction to computer graphics class and I despise TurboC (for the lack of a vim mode, obviously). So I wrote this single header library (if you could even call it that) that exposes an 
interface identical to turboC's `graphics.h` but creates an SFML window and draws pixels to it instead.
